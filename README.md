## Shunting Yard Algorithm

A Shunting Yard algorithm project to practice a new language I am learning - Scala. 
The purpose of the project is hence to learn more about the language and to prepare myself for lexical analysis
in a compiler project I am taking on soon.

### Supports
Supports unary operators such as `-3`, along with the standard operators.
Supports integered expressions, and expressions returning **integers**.
